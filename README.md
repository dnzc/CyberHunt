# CyberHunt

A collection of cyber challenges, made originally for school.

The challenges are up [here](https://dnzc.github.io/CyberHunt/). This repo has been made public so the challenges no longer need to be solved sequentially.

Writeups for the first 10 challenges: https://www.notion.so/CyberHunt-Writeups-a3a049be096a4d8c91123bea8495a2f5
