# CyberHunt

A collection of cyber challenges, made originally for school.



This repo has been made public since the challenge is over - most of the challenges should still work (they are up [here](https://dnzc.github.io/CyberHunt/)) but some live ones e.g. the last one don't.

This is currently being remastered into a better project with flask, similar to the layout of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
