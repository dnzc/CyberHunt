        <p>When you have your two answers, here's what to do: For each answer, convert them to base 16 then split them up into chunks of two. Convert each chunk of two hex digits as a separate number back to denary; this should be the ascii value of a character. When you are done decoding you should then have two strings. Concatenate them in the form {{minimum answer}} + {{maximum answer}}. This should be a bitly link; visit it to proceed.</p>
