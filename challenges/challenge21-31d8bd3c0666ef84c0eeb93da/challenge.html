    <body style="font-family: monospace;">
        <p>Fancy seeing you here. Congratulations on making it this far.</p>
        <p>Take a look at Mr. Baker's AoC Extra Challenge post on schoology.</p>
        <p>The bottom of the post mentions a bitly link. When you solve Mr. Baker's challenge and visit the bit.ly link, you are redirected to a certain URL.</p>
        <p>Calculate the lowercase md5 hash of this url (inclding https://). Then append this to the string "https://bit.ly/" and visit that link, which will give you the final flag.</p>
        <p>Send me an email with the final flag to show you've finished :)</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed the hunt.</p>
