(not an actual challenge)

Hello, friend.
“Hello, friend?” That’s lame.
Maybe I should give you a name.
But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head.
We have to remember that.
<redacted>.
It’s actually happened. I’m talking to an imaginary person.
What I’m about to tell you is top secret.
A conspiracy bigger than all of us.
There’s a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world.
I’m talking about the guys no one knows about.
The guys that are invisible.
The top one percent of the top one percent.
The guys that play God without permission.
And now I think they’re following me.
This is about last night.
I should’ve gone to Angela’s birthday party.
Instead, I went to...
Hey, Ron.
There you are.
You’re Ron?
But...
Your real name is Rohit D’Temeta.
You changed it to Ron when you bought your first
Ron’s Coffee shop six years ago.
Now, you got 17 of ’em with eight more coming next quarter.
May I help you with something?
I like coming here, ’cause your Wi-Fi was fast.
I mean, you’re one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.
It’s good.
I mean, it was so good, it scratched that part of my mind.
The part that...
...doesn’t allow good to exist without condition.
So, I started intercepting all the traffic on your network.
That’s when I noticed something strange.
That’s when I decided to hack you.
- Hack... - I know you run a website called Plato’s Boys.
Pardon me?
You’re using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous.
You made it really hard for anyone to see it.
But I saw it.
The onion routing protocol, it’s not as anonymous as you think it is.
Whoever’s in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic,
which makes me...
...the one in control.
- I must ask you to kindly leave, please. - I own everything.
All your emails. All your files.
All your pics.
Get out of here, right now, or I’ll call the...
Police?
I mean, you want them to find out about the hundred terabytes of <redacted>
you serve to your 400,000 users?
Personally, man,
I was hoping it was just gonna be some <redacted> stuff.
You realize how much simpler that would’ve been?
I did not hurt anyone.
I never did.
That’s my... personal life.
I understand what it’s like
to be different.
I’m very different, too.
I mean, I don’t <redacted>, but...
I don’t know how to talk to people.
My dad was the only one I could talk to.
But he died.
I’m sorry to hear that.
How did he pass, may I ask?
Leukemia.
Yeah, he definitely got it from
radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn’t prove it.
Now, he’s dead.
Company’s fine, though.
Hey...
It’s okay, Rohit.
You don’t have to worry anymore.
I don’t understand.
Are you blackmailing me?
So that’s what this is about? Money?
That’s all you care about?
No.
If I pay you now, you’ll want more and more.
No matter how much I give.
You will inform the police anyway.
I won’t pay you, sir.
Remember, you also broke the law.
Actually, you’re right.
Partly.
See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer,
but this time I wanted to do it AFK.
In person.
I’m trying to work on my social anxiety.
But there’s always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.
You know, you tell your sysadmin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.
So...
I made sure to include the current time and location on my anonymous tip.
Wait, hold on. I’ll give you the money. I’ll pay you.
How much do you want? I’ll pay you.
That’s the part you were wrong about, Rohit.
I
